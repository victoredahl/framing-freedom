# Theoretical Framework

We are interested in **attitudes toward protecting freedom of speech**, and to what extent those attitudes can be influenced by **elites** — in our case, well-known political social media personalities in Norway.

Specifically, we ask:  
**Does an endorsement of strong free speech protection by a controversial, young right-wing politician generate different patterns of support** than the exact same message when attributed to "society at large"?

This study contributes to the growing body of research in **political psychology** on *elite-citizen communication* and *opinion framing effects* — particularly on how the **identity of the messenger** shapes how a message is received.

> _“The effectiveness of political framing depends not just on the message — but on **who** delivers it.”_  
> — Druckman (2001), *Journal of Politics*  
> Lupia (2013), *PNAS*

# Hypotheses

:::{.callout-note}
### H1 — Polarization Through Personality  
We hypothesize that an endorsement of free speech by a **controversial political personality** will lead to **greater polarization** in responses.  
Put simply: when the message comes from a political and openly ideological social media figure, participants will be more divided in their level of agreement compared to when the message comes from a **non-political source**.

### H2 — Gender-Based Polarization  
We expect that this polarization will vary significantly by **gender**.  
Male respondents will be **more likely to agree** with the political figure’s endorsement of free speech than female respondents.  
This gender-based polarization is expected to be **less pronounced** in the case of the non-political source.

## Visual Summary of Hypotheses

The table below summarizes our core expectations about how framing source and gender interact in shaping responses to a message about protecting freedom of speech.

| Framing Source                          | Male Response                | Female Response              |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Right-leaning Political Elite**       | Higher agreement (↑)         | Lower agreement (↓)          |
| **Non-Political Source (Society at Large)** | Similar moderate agreement (→) | Similar moderate agreement (→) |
