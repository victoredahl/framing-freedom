### A political science survey project at the University of Stavanger

**How does political framing shape young people's perceptions of freedom of speech — and whether it’s under threat?**

This website presents a quantitative research project led by bachelor students in political science at the University of Stavanger (UiS). The study explores how the framing of freedom of speech — particularly by well-known, right-leaning politicians — may influence **how high school students perceive the state of free speech today**.

The data will be collected through a survey developed specifically for **“Åpen dag 2025”** at UiS, where visiting students engage with the university and learn about future study opportunities.
